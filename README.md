# Weather App

This is example app for my course [basicreact.com](https://basicreact.com). To run the app you'll also need an API key for [darksky.net](https://darksky.net) and a running proxy server (as they don't allow CORS). You can setup server using [this repo](https://github.com/satansdeer/weather-api). Just click the "Deploy to Heroku" button and provide your Darksky api key.
